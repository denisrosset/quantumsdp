# A repository to explore semidefinite programs in quantum information

Right now, it contains two subprojects:

- `diagout`, a pseudo solver interface for CVX, useful to diagnose the problem size and dump the model to disk in SeDuMi format

- `doherty`, a study of three formulations of the Doherty hierarchy.
